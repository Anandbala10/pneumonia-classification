# pneumonia-classification
This project applies deep learning and transfer learning with VGG16 to classify chest X-ray images as Normal or Pneumonia. The model is trained on a public chest X-ray dataset and demonstrates how medical image classification can be achieved using pre-trained convolutional neural networks.
