# pneumonia-classification
This project applies deep learning and transfer learning with VGG16 to classify chest X-ray images as Normal or Pneumonia. The model is trained on a public chest X-ray dataset and demonstrates how medical image classification can be achieved using pre-trained convolutional neural networks.
This project uses the publicly available **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset  
available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).  
Please download it separately and place it in a folder named `chest_xray/` before running the code.
